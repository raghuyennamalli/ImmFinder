In addition, RNASEL is implicated in the protection of central nervous system against viral-induced demyelination. A broader role in innate immunity is suggested by involvement of RNASEL in cytokine induction and endosomal pathways that suppress bacterial infections.
.RNA cleavage products, catalyzed by RNASEL, bind to DHX33 to facilitate the formation of a complex with MAVS and NLRP3 during viral infection.

Although the three TLR3 contact sites individually interact weakly with their binding partners, together they form a high affinity ligand-receptor complex..TLR3 deletion dramatically enhanced the development of elastic lamina damage after collar-induced injury, indicating that TLR3 signalling plays a protective role in arterial vessel wall..TLR3 activation by Poly(I:C) in the endothelial cells induces Poly(I:C) dose- and time-dependent cell apoptosis. Specifically, TLR3 stimulation triggered the signalling of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways..TLR3 requires proteolytic processing in endolysosome by asparagine endopeptidase and cathepsin in the endolysosome to initiate signalling in response to DNA. (Demonstrated in murine model).TLR3 expression is inducible by LPS via TLR4-MYD88-IRAK-TRAF6-NFKB dependent signalling pathway..TLR3 is necessary to establish an antiviral state in hepatocytes infected with hepatitis C Virus. HCV envelope proteins counteract the antiviral host defence by inhibiting the expression of TLR3..TLR3 signalling is enhanced by the presence of viral double-strand RNA-binding proteins..TLR3-TICAM1-mediated signalling pathway plays an essential role in the anti-viral response against poliovirus infection. (Demonstrated in mice).TLR3 is constitutively expressed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and has the ability to activate anti-viral responses. (Demonstrated in mice).Upon engagement with its ligand, dsRNA, TLR3 possesses the ability to recruit CASP8 and RIPK1 to induce apoptosis..Activation of TLR3 with poly(I:C) mediates antiviral immunity that diminishes coronavirus production in macrophages. (Demonstrated in mice).Upregulation of TLR3 in intestinal epithelia during infancy may contribute to age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. (Demonstrated in mice).TLR3 activation differentially regulates phagocytosis of bacteria and apoptotic neutrophils by peritoneal macrophages. (Demonstrated in mice).TLR3 is more efficiently activated by high molecular mass than by low molecular weight poly(I:C)..TLR3-mediated antibody response to Chikungunya virus plays a key role in its infection, replication and pathology. 
.Intracellular/endocytic TLR3 interacts with SCARF 1 in the presence of Poly I:C to boost TLR3-mediated inflammatory signalling and stimulate cytokine production in macrophages..Signalling through both DDX58 and TLR3 is important for interferon induction by influenza A virus in alveolar epithelial cells. .Bluetongue virus activates TLR3/interferons signalling pathway resulting in the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus in macrophages.",True,sub,immune
